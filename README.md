# StaticCodeAnalyzer
## Graduation Project of the Python Core Track at JetBrains Academy
It is a command line program to test your python source code files .
It reports issues according to PEP8.
Just give the name or path of your pyhton file or the directory in which your python files are located as a command line argument.
The program will analyze every python file it finds, line by line and list the issues it finds.
The issues will be listed according to the path of the file, the line number where the issue is found.
Every issue is reported with an error message including the error code from S001 to S012 and an error message.
The error message describes the error and sometimes, depending on the error type, specifies the name to which the issue relates.
